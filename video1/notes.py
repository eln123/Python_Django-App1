# Django tutorial - Setup, Installation, and Page Navigation

# video 1 is about setting up project (installation), how Django works, getting the server running, 
# Other videos are about databases, templates, etc. 


# Django is a fullstack web framework that allows you to create websites with pure Python and a little bit of html
# This is great because typically when you make websites, you need a combination of Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP, etc.
    # if you know Python, Django is a good way to create nice and fully functional websites



# Installation
    # command: pip3 install django
    # if you hit enter and doesn't work, he has a video for what to do

# Getting started
    # he is working in a virtual environment, so he does the command "activate django"

    # to create a project, do the command: django-admin startproject name_of_project 
            # - you can't name the project anything that is a python package, like numpi or pygame
            # - what I did, is cd to video1 directory, and did: django-admin startproject video1project
